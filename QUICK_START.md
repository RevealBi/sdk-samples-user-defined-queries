## Customization Tips

### Change the Purple Color
In `client/styles/main.css`, find and replace:
- `#6A44FF` (primary)
- `#8A6DFF` (light/gradient)
- `#5838d1` (dark/hover)

### Adjust Card Size
In `client/styles/main.css`, line ~450:
```css
.queries-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(320px, 1fr));
    /* Change 320px to your preferred minimum card width */
}
```

### Sidebar Width
In `client/styles/main.css`, line ~50:
```css
.sidebar {
    width: 256px; /* Change this value */
}
```

## API Integration

Your JavaScript expects a `/queries` endpoint that returns:

```json
[
  {
    "guid": "abc-123",
    "name": "Sales Report",
    "description": "Monthly sales data",
    "sql": "SELECT * FROM sales WHERE...",
    "createdDate": "2025-10-16T10:30:00Z"
  }
]
```

Update `API_BASE_URL` in `client/scripts/main.js` if your server runs on a different port.

## Troubleshooting

### Queries Not Loading?
- Check console for API errors
- Verify server is running on correct port
- Update `API_BASE_URL` in `main.js`

### Dashboard Not Displaying?
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Reveal SDK scripts are loading
- Check GUID is being passed correctly in URL

### Sidebar Not Working?
- Ensure `main.js` is loaded
- Check for JavaScript errors in console

## Next Steps

1. **Test with Real Data**: Connect to your actual API
2. **Add Features**: Delete queries, rename, etc.
3. **Customize Colors**: Match your brand
4. **Deploy**: Move to production environment
